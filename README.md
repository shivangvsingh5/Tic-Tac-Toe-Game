# Tic Tac Toe Game

I have created a **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**, using Python language and **PyCharm IDE**. 
In this game, I have made the following provisions :

1. There are **2 players** in the game and both are able to play the game.
2. The board is **printed out each time, any player makes a move**.
3. Accept the input as given by the player and put it on the board and **play simultaneously**.
